psRNATarget expectation

Expectation value is the penalty for the mismatches between mature small RNA and the target sequence. A higher value indicates less similarity (and possibility) between small RNA and the target candidate. The default penalty rule is set up by the scoring schema. Maximum expectation is the cutoff; any small RNA-target pair with an expectation less than the cutoff will be discarded in the final result. The recommended values are 3.0-5.0 depending on the scoring schema.
